# BattleGame
Text-based game that resembles Pokemon

This program is a battle game program where the user needs to input the number of creatures competing in the game as well as their names. The program will generate all the creatures with random food, health and fire power units. Then, the program will choose a random creature to start and will prompt the user to choose between several options at each creature's turn to play.

The goal of the program is that the creatures fight each other in a turn base game until only one creature is left alive which will terminate the program and it will be game over.
